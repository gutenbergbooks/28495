<h2>SCALLY</h2>

<h3>THE STORY OF A PERFECT
GENTLEMAN</h3>




<h2>I</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Bettersea</span> trem? Right, miss!"
My wife, who has been married long
enough to feel deeply gratified at
being mistaken for a maiden lady,
smiled seraphically at the conductor,
and allowed herself to be hoisted up
the steps of the majestic vehicle provided
by a paternal county council to
convey passengers&mdash;at a loss to the
ratepayers, I understand&mdash;from the
Embankment to Battersea.</p>

<p>Presently we ground our way
round a curve and began to cross
Westminster Bridge. The conductor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
whose innate cockney bonhomie his
high official position had failed to
eradicate, presented himself before us
and collected our fares.</p>

<p>"What part of Bettersea did you
require, sir?" he asked of me.</p>

<p>I coughed and answered evasively:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, about the middle."</p>

<p>"We haven't been there before,"
added my wife, quite gratuitously.</p>

<p>The conductor smiled indulgently
and punched our tickets.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when to get down,"
he said, and left us.</p>

<p>For some months we had been considering
the question of buying a dog,
and a good deal of our spare time&mdash;or
perhaps I should say of my spare
time, for a woman's time is naturally
all her own&mdash;had been pleasantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
occupied in discussing the matter.
Having at length committed ourselves
to the purchase of the animal,
we proceeded to consider such details
as breed, sex, and age.</p>

<p>My wife vacillated between a
bloodhound, because bloodhounds
are so aristocratic in appearance, and
a Pekinese, because they are <i>dernier
cri</i>. We like to be <i>dernier cri</i> even in
Much Moreham. Her younger sister,
Eileen, who spends a good deal of
time with us, having no parents of her
own, suggested an Old English sheep
dog, explaining that it would be company
for my wife when I was away
from home. I coldly recommended a
mastiff.</p>

<p>Our son John, aged three, on being
consulted, expressed a preference for
twelve tigers in a box, and was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
again invited to participate in the
debate.</p>

<p>Finally we decided on an Aberdeen
terrier, of an age and sex to be settled
by circumstances, and I was instructed
to communicate with a gentleman
in the North who advertised
in our morning paper that Aberdeen
terriers were his specialty. In due
course we received a reply. The advertiser
recommended two animals&mdash;namely,
Celtic Chief, aged four
months, and Scotia's Pride, aged one
year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each
about as complicated as the family
tree of the House of Hapsburg; and
the favor of an early reply was requested,
as both dogs were being
hotly bid for by an anonymous client
in Constantinople.</p>

<p>The price of Celtic Chief was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
twenty guineas; that of Scotia's
Pride, for reasons heavily underlined
in the pedigree, was twenty-seven.
The advertiser, who resided in Aberdeen,
added that these prices did not
cover cost of carriage. We decided
not to stand in the way of the gentleman
in Constantinople, and having
sent back the pedigrees by return of
post, resumed the debate.</p>

<p>Finally Stella, my wife, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We don't really want a dog with
a pedigree. We only want something
that will bark at beggars and be gentle
with baby. Why not go to the
Home for Lost Dogs at Battersea? I
believe you can get any dog you like
there for five shillings. We will run
up to town next Wednesday and see
about it&mdash;and I might get some
clothes as well."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence our presence on the tram.</p>

<p>Presently the conductor, who had
kindly pointed out to us such objects
of local interest as the River
Thames and the Houses of Parliament,
stopped the tram in a crowded
thoroughfare and announced that
we were in Battersea.</p>

<p>"Alight here," he announced facetiously,
"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!"</p>

<p>Guiltily realizing that there is many
a true word spoken in jest, we obeyed
him, and the tram went rocking and
whizzing out of sight. We had
eschewed a cab.</p>

<p>"When you are only going to pay
five shillings for a dog," my wife had
pointed out, with convincing logic,
"it is silly to go and pay perhaps another
five shillings for a cab. It
doubles the price of the dog at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
If we had been buying an expensive
dog we might have taken a cab; but
not for a five-shilling one."</p>

<p>"Now," I inquired briskly, "how
are we going to find this place?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you any idea where it
is?"</p>

<p>"No. I have a sort of vague notion
that it is on an island in the middle
of the river, called the Isle of Dogs,
or Barking Reach, or something like
that. However, I have no doubt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better ask some one?"
suggested Stella.</p>

<p>I demurred.</p>

<p>"If there is one thing I dislike," I
said, "it is accosting total strangers
and badgering them for information
they don't possess&mdash;not that that
will prevent them from giving it. If
we start asking the way we shall find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in
no time!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said Stella soothingly.</p>

<p>"Now I suggest&mdash;" My hand
went to my pocket.</p>

<p>"No, darling," interposed my wife,
hastily; "not a map, please!" It is a
curious psychological fact that women
have a constitutional aversion to
maps and railroad time-tables. They
would rather consult a half-witted
errand boy or a deaf railroad porter.
"Do not let us make a spectacle of
ourselves in the public streets again!
I have not yet forgotten the day when
you tried to find the Crystal Palace.
Besides, it will only blow away. Ask
that dear little boy there. He is looking
at us so wistfully."</p>

<p>Yes; I admit it was criminal folly.
A man who asks a London street boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to be so kind as to direct him to a
Home for Lost Dogs has only himself
to thank for the consequence.</p>

<p>The wistful little boy smiled up at
us. He had a pinched face and large
eyes.</p>

<p>"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?" he said
courteously. "It's a good long way.
Do you want to get there quick?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then if I was you, sir," replied
the infant, edging to the mouth of an
alleyway, "I should bite a policeman!"
And, with an ear-splitting
yell, he vanished.</p>

<p>We walked on, hot-faced.</p>

<p>"Little wretch!" said Stella.</p>

<p>"We simply asked for it," I rejoined.
"What are we going to do
next?"</p>

<p>My question was answered in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
most incredible fashion, for at this
moment a man emerged from a shop
on our right and set off down the
street before us. He wore a species of
uniform; and emblazoned on the
front of his hat was the information
that he was an official of the Battersea
Home for Lost and Starving
Dogs.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute and I will ask
him," I said, starting forward.</p>

<p>But my wife would not hear of it.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she replied. "If
we ask him he will simply offer to
show us the way. Then we shall have
to talk to him&mdash;about hydrophobia,
and lethal chambers, and distemper&mdash;and
it may be for miles. I simply
couldn't bear it! We shall have to
tip him, too. Let us follow him
quietly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>To those who have never attempted
to track a fellow creature surreptitiously
through the streets of
London on a hot day, the feat may
appear simple. It is in reality a most
exhausting, dilatory, and humiliating
exercise. Our difficulty lay not so
much in keeping our friend in sight
as in avoiding frequent and unexpected
collisions with him. The
general idea, as they say on field
days, was to keep about twenty
yards behind him; but under certain
circumstances distance has an uncanny
habit of annihilating itself.
The man himself was no hustler.
Once or twice he stopped to light
his pipe or converse with a friend.</p>

<p>During these interludes Stella and
I loafed guiltily on the pavement,
pointing out to one another objects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of local interest with the fatuous
officiousness of people in the foreground
of hotel advertisements. Occasionally
he paused to contemplate
the contents of a shop window. We
gazed industriously into the window
next door. Our first window, I recollect,
was an undertaker's, with ready-printed
expressions of grief for sale
on white porcelain disks. We had
time to read them all. The next was
a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce,
so long that the proprietor,
who was of the tribe that disposes of
its wares almost entirely by personal
canvass, came out into the street
and endeavored to sell us a bullock's
heart.</p>

<p>Our quarry's next proceeding was
to dive into a public house. We
turned and surveyed one another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are we to do now?" inquired
my wife.</p>

<p>"Go inside, too," I replied with
more enthusiasm than I had hitherto
displayed. "At least, I think I ought
to. You can please yourself."</p>

<p>"I will not be left in the street,"
said Stella firmly. "We must just
wait here together until he comes out."</p>

<p>"There may be another exit," I
objected. "We had better go in. I
shall take something, just to keep up
appearances; and you must sit down
in the ladies' bar, or the snug, or
whatever they call it."</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" said Stella.</p>

<p>We had arrived at this <i>impasse</i>
when the man suddenly reappeared,
wiping his mouth. Instantly and silently
we fell in behind him.</p>

<p>For the first time the man appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to notice our presence. He
regarded us curiously, with a faint
gleam of recognition in his eyes, and
then set off down the street at a good
pace. We followed, panting. Once or
twice he looked back over his shoulder
a little apprehensively, I thought.
But we ploughed on.</p>

<p>"We ought to get there soon at
this pace," I gasped. "Hello! He's
gone again!"</p>

<p>"He turned down to the right,"
said Stella excitedly.</p>

<p>The lust of the chase was fairly on
us now. We swung eagerly round
the corner into a quiet by-street.
Our man was nowhere to be seen and
the street was almost empty.</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Stella. "He may
have turned in somewhere."</p>

<p>We hurried down the street. Suddenly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
warned by a newly awakened
and primitive instinct, I looked back.
We had overrun our quarry. He had
just emerged from some hiding place
and was heading back toward the
main street, looking fearfully over his
shoulder. Once more we were in full
cry.</p>

<p>For the next five minutes we practically
ran&mdash;all three of us. The
man was obviously frightened out of
his wits, and kept making frenzied
and spasmodic spurts, from which we
surmised that he was getting to the
end of his powers of endurance.</p>

<p>"If only we could overtake him,"
I said, hauling my exhausted spouse
along by the arm, "we could explain
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's gone again!" exclaimed
Stella.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>She was right. The man had turned
another corner. We followed him
round hotfoot, and found ourselves
in a prim little <i>cul-de-sac</i>, with villas
on each side. Across the end of the
street ran a high wall, obviously
screening a railroad track.</p>

<p>"We've got him!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>I felt as Moltke must have felt
when he closed the circle at Sedan.</p>

<p>"But where is the Dogs' Home,
dear?" inquired Stella.</p>

<p>The question was never answered,
for at this moment the man ran up
the steps of the fourth villa on the
left and slipped a latchkey into the
lock. The door closed behind him
with a venomous snap and we were
left alone in the street, guideless and
dogless.</p>

<p>A minute later the man appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
at the ground-floor window, accompanied
by a female of commanding
appearance. He pointed us out to
her. Behind them we could dimly
descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy
and covered dishes.</p>

<p>The commanding female, after a
prolonged and withering glare,
plucked a hairpin from her head and
ostentatiously proceeded to skewer
together the starchy white curtains
that framed the window. Privacy
secured and the sanctity of the English
home thus pointedly vindicated,
she and her husband disappeared
into the murky background, where
they doubtless sat down to an excellent
high tea. Exhausted and discomfited,
we drifted away.</p>

<p>"I am going home," said Stella in
a hollow voice. "And I think," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
added bitterly, "that it might have
occurred to you to suggest that the
creature might possibly be going
from the Dogs' Home and not to it."</p>

<p>I apologized. It is the simplest
plan, really.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was almost dark when the train
arrived at our little country station.
We set out to walk home by the short
cut across the golf course.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,"
remarked Stella.</p>

<p>"We paid half a crown for that taxi
which took us back to Victoria Station,"
I reminded her.</p>

<p>"Do not argue to-night, darling,"
responded my wife. "I simply cannot
endure anything more."</p>

<p>Plainly she was a little unstrung.
Very considerately, I selected another
topic.</p>

<p>"I think our best plan," I said
cheerfully, "would be to advertise
for a dog."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never wish to see a dog again,"
replied Stella.</p>

<p>I surveyed her with some concern
and said gently:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are tired, dear."</p>

<p>"No; I'm not."</p>

<p>"A little shaken, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what
is that?"</p>

<p>Stella's fingers bit deep into my
biceps muscle, causing me considerable
pain. We were passing a small
sheet of water which guards the thirteenth
green on the golf course. It is
a stagnant and unclean pool, but we
make rather a fuss of it. We call it
the pond; and if you play a ball into
it you send a blasphemous caddie in
after it and count one stroke.</p>

<p>A young moon was struggling up
over the trees, dismally illuminating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the scene. On the slimy shores of the
pond we beheld a small moving object.</p>

<p>A yard behind it was another object,
a little smaller, moving at exactly
the same pace. One of the objects
was emitting sounds of distress.</p>

<p>Abandoning my quaking consort
I advanced to the edge of the pond
and leaned down to investigate the
mystery.</p>

<p>The leading object proved to be
a small, wet, shivering, whimpering
puppy. The satellite was a brick.
The two were connected by a string.
The puppy had just emerged from
the depths of the pond, towing the
brick behind it.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" repeated Stella
fearfully.</p>

<p>"Your dog!" I replied, and cut the
string.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> spent three days deciding on a
name for him. Stella suggested Tiny,
on account of his size. I pointed out
that time might stultify this selection
of a title.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Eileen,
supporting her sister. "That kind of
dog does not grow very big."</p>

<p>"What kind of dog is he?" I inquired
swiftly.</p>

<p>Eileen said no more. There are
problems that even girls of twenty
cannot solve.</p>

<p>A warm bath had revealed to us
the fact that the puppy was of a
dingy yellow hue. I suggested that
we should call him Mustard. Our
son John, on being consulted&mdash;against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
my advice&mdash;by his mother,
addressed the animal as Pussy. Stella
continued to favor Tiny. Finally
Eileen, who was at the romantic age,
produced a copy of Tennyson and
suggested Excalibur, alleging in support
of her preposterous proposition
that</p>

<div class='center'>It rose from out the bosom of the lake.<br />
</div>

<p>"The darling rose from out the
bosom of the lake, too, just like the
sword Excalibur," she said; "so I
think it would make a lovely name
for him."</p>

<p>"The little brute waded out of a
muddy pond towing a brick," I replied.
"I see no parallel. He was not
the product of the pond. Some one
must have thrown him in, and he
came out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is just what some one must
have done with the sword," retorted
Eileen. "So we'll call you Excalibur,
won't we, darling little Scally?"</p>

<p>She embraced the puppy warmly
and the unsuspecting animal replied
by frantically licking her face.</p>

<p>However, the name stuck, with
variations. When the puppy was big
enough he was presented with a collar,
engraved with the name Excalibur,
together with my name and
address. Among ourselves we usually
addressed him as Scally. The children
in the village called him the
Scalawag.</p>

<p>His time during his first year in our
household was fully occupied in growing
up. Stella declared that if one
could have persuaded him to stand
still for five minutes it would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
been actually possible to see him
grow. He grew at the rate of about
an inch a week for the best part of a
year. When he had finished he looked
like nothing on earth. At one time
we cherished a brief but illusory hope
that he was going to turn into some
sort of an imitation of a St. Bernard;
but the symptoms rapidly passed off,
and his final and permanent aspect
was that of a rather badly stuffed
lion.</p>

<p>Like most overgrown creatures he
was top-heavy and lethargic and
very humble-minded. Still, there
was a kind of respectful pertinacity
about him. It requires some strength
of character, for instance, to wade
along the bottom of a pond to dry
land, accompanied by a brick as big
as yourself. It was quite impossible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
too, short of locking him up, to prevent
him from accompanying us
when we took our walks abroad, if
he had made up his mind to do so.</p>

<p>The first time this happened I was
going to shoot with my neighbors,
the Hoods. It was only a mile to the
first covert and I set off after breakfast
to walk. I was hardly out on the
road when Excalibur was beside me,
ambling uncertainly on his weedy
legs and smiling up into my face with
an air of imbecile affection.</p>

<p>"You have many qualities, old
friend," I said, "but I don't think
you are a sporting dog. Go home!"</p>

<p>Excalibur sat down on the road
with a dejected air. Then, having
given me fifty yards start, he rose
and crawled sheepishly after me. I
stopped, called him up, pointed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with some difficulty in the required
direction, gave him a resounding
spank and bade him begone. He
responded by collapsing like a camp
bedstead, and I left him.</p>

<p>Two minutes later I looked round.
Excalibur was ten yards behind me,
propelling himself along on his stomach.
This time I thrashed him severely.
After he began to howl I let
him go, and he lumbered away homeward,
the picture of misery.</p>

<p>In due course I reached the crossroads
where I had arranged to meet
the rest of the party. They had not
arrived, but Excalibur had. He had
made a d&eacute;tour and headed me off.
Not certain which route I would take
after reaching the crossroads, he was
sitting very sensibly under the signpost,
awaiting my arrival. On seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
me he immediately came forward,
wagging his tail, and placed himself
at my feet in the position most convenient
to me for inflicting chastisement.</p>

<p>I wonder how many of our human
friends would be willing to pay such a
price for the pleasure of our company.</p>

<p>As time went on Excalibur filled
out into one of the most terrifying
spectacles I have ever beheld. In
one respect, though, he lived up to
his knightly name. His manners were
of the most courtly description and
he had an affectionate greeting for
all, beggars included. He was particularly
fond of children. If he saw
children in the distance he would
canter up and offer to play with them.
If the children had not met him before
they would run shrieking to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
nurses. If they had they would fall
on Excalibur in a body and roll him
over and pull him about.</p>

<p>On wet afternoons, in the nursery,
my own family used to play at dentist
with him, assigning to Excalibur
the r&ocirc;le of patient. Gas was administered
with a bicycle pump, and a
shoehorn and buttonhook were employed
in place of the ordinary instruments
of torture; but Excalibur did
not mind. He lay on his back on the
hearth rug, with the principal dentist
sitting astride his ribs, as happy as a
king.</p>

<p>He was particularly attracted by
babies; and being able by reason of
his stature to look right down into
perambulators, he was accustomed
whenever he met one of those vehicles
to amble alongside and peer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
inquiringly into the face of its occupant.
Most of the babies in the district
got to know him in time, but
until they did we had a good deal of
correspondence to attend to on the
subject.</p>

<p>Excalibur's intellect may have
been lofty, but his memory was
treacherous. Our household will never
forget the day on which he was
given the shoulder of mutton.</p>

<p>One morning after breakfast Eileen,
accompanied by Excalibur, intercepted
the kitchen maid hastening
in the direction of the potting shed,
carrying the joint in question at
arm's length. The damsel explained
that its premature maturity was due
to the recent warm weather and that
she was even now in search of the
gardener's boy, who would be commissioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to perform the duties of
sexton.</p>

<p>"It seems a waste, miss," observed
the kitchen maid; "but cook says it
can't be ate nohow now."</p>

<p>Loud but respectful snuffings from
Excalibur moved a direct negative to
this statement. Eileen and the kitchen
maid, who were both criminally
weak where Excalibur was concerned,
saw a way to gratify their economical
instincts and their natural affection
simultaneously. The next moment
Excalibur was lurching contentedly
down the gravel path with a presentation
shoulder of mutton in his
mouth.</p>

<p>Then Joy Day began. Excalibur
took his prize into the middle of the
tennis lawn. It was a very large
shoulder of mutton, but Excalibur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
finished it in ten minutes. After that,
distended to his utmost limits, he
went to sleep in the sun, with the
bone between his paws. Occasionally
he woke up and, raising his head,
stared solemnly into space, in the
attitude of a Trafalgar Square lion.</p>

<p>The bone now lay white and gleaming
on the grass beside him. Then he
fell asleep again. About four o'clock
he roused himself and began to look
for a suitable place of interment for
the bone. By four-thirty the deed
was done and he went to sleep once
more. At five he woke up and pandemonium began.
He could not remember
where he had buried the bone!</p>

<p>He started systematically with the
rose beds, but met with no success.
After that he tried two or three
shrubberies without avail, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
embarked on a frantic but thorough
excavation of the tennis lawn. We
were taking tea on the lawn at the
time, and our attention was first
drawn to Excalibur's bereavement by
a temporary but unshakable conviction
on his part that the bone was
buried immediately underneath the
tea table.</p>

<p>As the tennis lawn was fast beginning
to resemble a golf course we
locked Excalibur up in the washhouse,
where his hyena-like howls
rent the air for the rest of the evening,
penetrating even to the dining-room.
This was particularly unfortunate,
because we were having a dinner
party in honor of a neighbor who
had recently come to the district, no
less a personage, in fact, than the
new lord-lieutenant of the county and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
his lady. Stella was naturally anxious
that there should be no embarrassments
on such an occasion, and
it distressed her to think that these
people should imagine that we kept
a private torture chamber on the
premises.</p>

<p>However, dinner passed off quite
successfully and we adjourned to the
drawing-room. It was a chilly September
evening and Lady Wickham
was accommodated with a seat by
the fire in a large armchair, with a
cushion at her back. When the gentlemen
came in Eileen sang to us.
Fortunately the drawing-room is out
of range of the washhouse.</p>

<p>During Eileen's first song I sat by
Lady Wickham. Her expression was
one of patrician calm and well-bred
repose, but it seemed to me she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
not looking quite comfortable. I
was not feeling quite comfortable
myself. The atmosphere seemed a
trifle oppressive: perhaps we had
done wrong in having a fire after all.
Lady Wickham appeared to notice
it too. She sat very upright, fanning
herself mechanically, and seemed disinclined
to lean back in her chair.</p>

<p>After the song was finished I said:</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are not quite
comfortable, Lady Wickham. Let
me get you a larger cushion."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Lady Wickham,
"the cushion I have is delightfully
comfortable; but I think there
is something hard behind it."</p>

<p>Apologetically I plucked away the
cushion. Lady Wickham was right;
there was something behind it.</p>

<p>It was Excalibur's bone!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A walk</span> along the village street was
always a great event for Excalibur.
Still, it must have contained many
humiliating moments for one of his
sensitive disposition; for he was always
pathetically anxious to make
friends with other dogs, but was
rarely successful. Little dogs merely
bit his legs and big dogs cut him dead.</p>

<p>I think this was why he usually
commenced his morning round by
calling on a rabbit. The rabbit lived
in a hutch in a yard at the end of
a passage between two cottages, the
first turning on the right after you
entered the village, and Excalibur always
dived down this at the earliest
opportunity. It was no use for Eileen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
who usually took him out on
these occasions, to endeavor to hold
him back. Either Excalibur called
on the rabbit by himself or Eileen
went with him; there was no other
alternative.</p>

<p>Arrived at the hutch, Excalibur
wagged his tail and contemplated
the rabbit with his usual air of vacuous
benevolence. The rabbit made
not the faintest response, but continued
to munch green feed, twitching
its nose in a superior manner.
Finally, when it could endure Excalibur's
admiring inspection and
hard breathing no longer, it turned
its back and retired into its bedroom.</p>

<p>Excalibur's next call was usually at
the butcher's shop, where he was
presented with a specially selected
and quite unsalable fragment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
meat. He then crossed the road to
the baker's, where he purchased a
halfpenny bun, for which his escort
was expected to pay. After that he
walked from shop to shop, wherever
he was taken, with great docility and
enjoyment; for he was a gregarious
animal and had a friend behind or
underneath almost every counter in
the village. Men, women, babies,
kittens, even ducks&mdash;they were all
one to him.</p>

<p>At one time Eileen had endeavored
to teach him a few simple accomplishments,
such as begging for food,
dying for his country, and carrying
parcels. She was unsuccessful in all
three instances. Excalibur on his
hind legs stood about five feet six,
and when he fell from that eminence,
as he invariably did when he tried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
beg, he usually broke something. He
was hampered, too, by inability to
distinguish one order from another.
More than once he narrowly escaped
with his life through mistaking
an urgent appeal to come to heel out
of the way of an approaching automobile
for a command to die for his
country in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>As for educating him to carry parcels,
a single attempt was sufficient.
The parcel in question contained a
miscellaneous assortment of articles
from the grocer's, including lard, soap,
and safety matches. It was securely
tied up, and the grocer kindly attached
it by a short length of string
to a wooden clothespin, in order to
make it easier for Excalibur to carry.
They set off home.</p>

<p>Excalibur was most apologetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
about it afterward, besides being extremely
unwell; but he had no idea,
he explained to Eileen, that anything
put into his mouth was not meant
to be eaten. He then tendered the
clothespin and some mangled brown
paper, with an air of profound abasement.
After that no further attempts
at compulsory education were undertaken.</p>

<p>It was his daily walk with Eileen,
however, which introduced Excalibur
to life&mdash;life in its broadest and most
romantic sense. As I was not privileged
to be present at the opening
incident of this episode, or at most
of its subsequent developments, the
direct conduct of this narrative here
passes out of my hands.</p>

<p>One sunny morning in July a young
man in clerical attire sat breakfasting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in his rooms at Mrs. Tice's. Mrs.
Tice's establishment was situated on
the village street and Mrs. Tice was
in the habit of letting her ground
floor to lodgers of impeccable respectability.</p>

<p>It was half-past eleven, which is a
late hour for the clergy to breakfast;
but this young man appeared to be
suffering from no qualms of conscience
on the subject. He was making
an excellent breakfast and reading
the Henley results with a mixture
of rapture and longing.</p>

<p>He had just removed the "Sportsman"
from the convenient buttress of
the teapot and substituted "Punch"
when he became aware that day had
turned to night. Looking up he perceived
that his open window, which
was rather small and of the casement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
variety, was completely blocked by
a huge, shapeless, and opaque mass.
Next moment the mass resolved itself
into an animal of enormous size
and surprising appearance, which
fell heavily into the room, and</p>

<div class='poem'>
Like a stream that, spouting from a cliff,<br />
Fails in mid-air, but, gathering at the base,<br />
Remakes itself,<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>rose to its feet and, advancing to the
table, laid a heavy head on the white
cloth and lovingly passed its tongue&mdash;which
resembled that of the great
anteater&mdash;round a cold chicken conveniently
adjacent.</div>

<p>Five minutes later the window
framed another picture&mdash;this time
a girl of twenty, white-clad and wearing
a powder-blue felt hat, caught up
on one side by a silver buckle which
twinkled in the hot morning sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
The curate started to his feet. Excalibur,
who was now lying on the
hearthrug dismembering the chicken,
thumped his tail guiltily on the floor,
but made no attempt to rise.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said Eileen,
"but I am afraid my dog is trespassing.
May I call him out?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said the curate.
"But"&mdash;he racked his brains to
devise some means of delaying the
departure of this radiant, fragrant
vision&mdash;"he is not the least in the
way. I am very glad of his company;
it was most neighborly of him to call.
After all, I suppose he is one of
my parishioners. And&mdash;and"&mdash;he
blushed&mdash;"I hope you are, too."</p>

<p>Eileen gave him her most entrancing
smile, and from that hour the curate
ceased to be his own master.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you are Mr. Gilmore,"
said Eileen.</p>

<p>"Yes. I have been here only three
weeks and I have not met every one
yet."</p>

<p>"I have been away for two
months," Eileen mentioned.</p>

<p>"I thought you must have been,"
said the curate, rather subtly for him.</p>

<p>"I think my brother-in-law called
on you a few days ago," continued
Eileen, on whom the curate's last remark
had made a most favorable
impression. She mentioned my name.</p>

<p>"I was going to return the call this
very afternoon," said the curate.
And he firmly believed that he was
speaking the truth. "Won't you
come in? We have an excellent chaperon,"
indicating Excalibur. "I will
come and open the door."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, he certainly won't come out
unless I come and fetch him," admitted
Eileen thoughtfully.</p>

<p>A moment later the curate was at
the front door and led his visitor
across the little hall into the sitting-room.
He had not been absent more
than thirty seconds, but during that
time a plateful of sausages had mysteriously
disappeared; and, as they
entered, Excalibur was apologetically
settling down on the hearthrug with a
cottage loaf between his paws.</p>

<p>Eileen uttered cries of dismay and
apology, but the curate would have
none of them.</p>

<p>"My fault entirely!" he insisted.
"I have no right to be breakfasting
at this hour; but this is my day off.
You see I take early Service every
morning at seven; but on Wednesdays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
we cut it out&mdash;omit it and
have full Matins at ten. So I get up
at half-past nine, take Service at ten,
and come back to my rooms at eleven
and have breakfast. It is my weekly
treat."</p>

<p>"You deserve it," said Eileen feelingly.
Her religious exercises were
limited to going to church on Sunday
morning and coming out, if possible,
after the Litany. "And how do you
like Much Moreham?"</p>

<p>"I did not like it at all when I
came," said the curate, "but recently
I have begun to enjoy myself
immensely." He did not say how
recently.</p>

<p>"Were you in London before?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in the East End. It was
pretty hard work, but a useful experience.
I feel rather lost here during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
my spare time. I get so little exercise.
In London I used to slip away
for an occasional outing in a Leander
scratch eight, and that kept me fit. I
am inclined," he added ruefully, "to
put on flesh."</p>

<p>"Leander? Are you a Blue?"</p>

<p>The curate nodded.</p>

<p>"You know about rowing, I see,"
he said appreciatively. "The worst
of rowing," he continued, "is that it
takes up so much of a man's time that
he has no opportunity of practicing
anything else&mdash;cricket, for instance.
All curates ought to be able to play
cricket. I do my best; but there isn't
a single boy in the Sunday School who
can't bowl me. It's humiliating!"</p>

<p>"Do you play tennis at all?"
asked Eileen.</p>

<p>"Yes, in a way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure my sister will be pleased
if you come and have a game with us
some afternoon."</p>

<p>The enraptured curate had already
opened his mouth to accept this demure
invitation when Excalibur, rising
from the hearthrug, stretched
himself luxuriously and wagged his
tail, thereby removing three pipes,
an inkstand, a tobacco jar, and a
half-completed sermon from the writing
table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Excalibur</span> was heavily overworked
in his new r&ocirc;le of chaperon
during the next three or four weeks,
and any dog less ready to oblige than
himself might have felt a little aggrieved
at the treatment to which he
was subjected.</p>

<p>There was the case of the tennis
lawn, for instance. He had always
regarded this as his own particular
sanctuary, dedicated to reflection and
repose; but now the net was stretched
across it and Eileen and the curate
performed antics all over the court
with rackets and small white balls
which, though they did not hurt Excalibur,
kept him awake. It did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
occur to him to convey himself elsewhere,
for his mind moved slowly;
and the united blandishments of the
players failed to bring the desirability
of such a course home to him. He
continued to lie in his favorite spot
on the sunny side of the court, looking
injured but forgiving, or slumbering
perseveringly amid the storm that
raged round him.</p>

<p>It was quite impossible to move
Excalibur once he had decided to remain
where he was; so Eileen and the
curate agreed to regard him as a sort
of artificial excrescence, like the buttress
in a fives court. If the ball hit
him, as it frequently did, the player
waiting for it was at liberty either to
play it or claim a let. This arrangement
added a piquant and pleasing
variety to what is too often&mdash;especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
when indulged in by mediocre
players&mdash;a very dull game.</p>

<p>Worse was to follow, however. One
day Eileen and the curate conducted
Excalibur to a neighboring mountain
range&mdash;at least, so it appeared to
Excalibur&mdash;and played another ball
game. This time they employed long
sticks with iron heads, and two balls,
which, though they were much smaller
than tennis balls, were incredibly
hard and painful. Excalibur, though
willing to help and anxious to please,
could not supervise both the balls at
once. As sure as he ran to retrieve
one the other came after him and
took him unfairly in the rear. Excalibur
was the gentlest of creatures, but
the most perfect gentleman has his
dignity to consider.</p>

<p>After having been struck for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
third time by one of these balls he
whipped round, picked it up in his
mouth and gave it a tiny pinch, just
as a warning. At least, he thought it
was a tiny pinch. The ball retaliated
with unexpected ferocity. It twisted
and turned. It emitted long, snaky
spirals of some elastic substance,
which clogged his teeth and tickled
his throat and wound themselves
round his tongue and nearly choked
him. Panic-stricken, he ran to his
mistress, who, with weeping and with
laughter, removed the writhing horror
from his jaws and comforted him
with fair words.</p>

<p>After that Excalibur realized that
it is wiser to walk behind golfers than
in front of them. It was a boring
business, though, and very exhausting,
for he loathed exercise of every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
kind; and his only periods of repose
were the occasions on which the expedition
came to a halt on certain
small, flat lawns, each of which contained
a hole with a flag in it.</p>

<p>Here Excalibur would lie down,
with the contented sigh of a tired
child, and go to sleep. As he almost
invariably lay down between the hole
and the ball, the players agreed to regard
him as a bunker. Eileen putted
round him; but the curate&mdash;who
had little regard for the humbler
works of creation, Excalibur thought&mdash;used
to take his mashie and attempt
a lofting shot, an enterprise in
which he almost invariably failed, to
Excalibur's great inconvenience.</p>

<p>Country walks were more tolerable,
for Eileen's supervision of his movements,
which was usually marked by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
an officious severity, was sensibly relaxed
on these days and Excalibur
found himself at liberty to range
abroad amid the heath and through
the coppices, engaged in a pastime
that he imagined was hunting.</p>

<p>One hot afternoon, wandering into
a clearing, he encountered a hare.
The hare, which was suffering from
extreme panic, owing to a terrifying
noise behind it,&mdash;the blast of the
newest and most vulgar motor horn,
to be precise,&mdash;was bolting right
across the clearing. After the manner
of hares where objects directly
in front of them are concerned, the
fugitive entirely failed to perceive
Excalibur and, indeed, ran right underneath
him on its way to cover.
Excalibur was so unstrung by this
adventure that he ran back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
where he had left Eileen and the
curate.</p>

<p>They were sitting side by side on
the grass and the curate was holding
Eileen's hand.</p>

<p>Excalibur advanced on them thankfully
and indicated by an ingratiating
smile that a friendly remark or
other recognition of his presence
would be gratefully received; but
neither took the slightest notice of
him. They continued to gaze straight
before them in a mournful and abstracted
fashion. They looked not
so much at Excalibur as through him.
First the hare, then Eileen and the
curate! Excalibur began to fear that
he had become invisible, or at least
transparent. Greatly agitated he
drifted away into a neighboring plantation
full of young pheasants. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he encountered a keeper, who was
able to dissipate his gloomy suspicions
for him without any difficulty
whatsoever. But Eileen and the curate
sat on.</p>

<p>"A hundred pounds a year!" repeated
the curate. "A pass degree
and no influence! I can't preach and
I have no money of my own. Dearest,
I ought never to have told
you."</p>

<p>"Told me what?" inquired Eileen
softly. She knew quite well; but she
was a woman, and a woman can never
let well enough alone.</p>

<p>The curate, turning to Eileen, delivered
himself of a statement of
three words. Eileen's reply was a
softly whispered <i>Tu quoque!</i></p>

<p>"It had to happen, dear," she
added cheerfully, for she did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
share the curate's burden of responsibility
in the matter. "If you had
not told me we should have been miserable
separately. Now that you
have told me, we can be miserable together.
And when two people who&mdash;who&mdash;"
She hesitated.</p>

<p>The curate supplied the relative
sentence. Eileen nodded her head in
acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"Yes; who are&mdash;like you and me&mdash;are
miserable together, they are
happy! See?"</p>

<p>"I see," said the curate gravely.
"Yes, you are right there; but we
can't go on living on a diet of joint
misery. We shall have to face the
future. What are we going to do
about it?"</p>

<p>Then Eileen spoke up boldly for
the first time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gerald," she said, "we shall simply
have to manage on a hundred a
year."</p>

<p>But the curate shook his head.</p>

<p>"Dearest, I should be an utter cad
if I allowed you to do such a thing,"
he said. "A hundred a year is less
than two pounds a week!"</p>

<p>"A lot of people live on less than
two pounds a week," Eileen pointed
out longingly.</p>

<p>"Yes; I know. If we could rent a
three-shilling cottage and I could go
about with a spotted handkerchief
round my neck, and you could scrub
the doorsteps <i>coram populo</i>, we might
be very comfortable; but the clergy
belong to the black-coated class, and
people in the lower ranks of the black-coated
class are the poorest people in
the whole wide world. They have to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
spend money on luxuries&mdash;collars
and charwomen, and so on&mdash;which
a workingman can spend entirely on
necessities. It wouldn't merely mean
no pretty dresses and a lot of hard
work for you, Eileen. It would mean
starvation! Believe me&mdash;I know!
Some of my friends have tried it&mdash;and
I know!"</p>

<p>"What happened to them?" asked
Eileen fearfully.</p>

<p>"They all had to come down in the
end&mdash;some soon, some late, but all
in time&mdash;to taking parish relief."</p>

<p>"Parish relief?"</p>

<p>"Yes; not official, regulation, rate-aided
charity, but the infinitely more
humiliating charity of their well-to-do
neighbors&mdash;quiet checks, second-hand
dresses, and things like that.
No, little girl; you and I are too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
proud&mdash;too proud of the cloth&mdash;for
that. We will never give a handle to
the people who are always waiting to
have a fling at the improvident clergy&mdash;not
if it breaks our hearts, we
won't!"</p>

<p>"You are quite right, dear," said
Eileen quietly. "We must wait."</p>

<p>Then the curate said the most difficult
thing he had said yet:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall have to go away from
here."</p>

<p>Eileen's hand turned cold in his.</p>

<p>"Why?" she whispered; but she
knew.</p>

<p>"Because if we wait here we shall
wait forever. The last curate in
Much Moreham&mdash;what happened
to him?"</p>

<p>"He died."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;at fifty-five; and he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
been here for thirty years. Preferment
does not come in sleepy villages.
I must go back to London."</p>

<p>"The East End?"</p>

<p>"East or south or north&mdash;it doesn't
signify. Anywhere but west. In
the east and south and north there is
always work to be done&mdash;hard work.
And if a parson has no money and
no brains and no influence, and can
only work&mdash;run clothing clubs and
soup kitchens, and reclaim drunkards&mdash;London
is the place for him. So off
I go to London, my beloved, to lay
the foundations of Paradise for you
and me&mdash;for you and me!"</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Then the
pair rose to their feet and smiled on
each other extremely cheerfully, because
each suspected the other&mdash;rightly&mdash;of
low spirits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall we tell people?" asked the
curate.</p>

<p>Eileen thought, and shook her
head.</p>

<p>"No," she said; "nicer not. It will
make a splendid secret."</p>

<p>"Just between us two, eh?" said
the curate, kindling at the thought.</p>

<p>"Just between us two," agreed
Eileen. And the curate kissed her
very solemnly. A secret is a comfortable
thing to lovers, especially when
they are young and about to be lonely.</p>

<p>At this moment a leonine head,
supported on a lumbering and ill-balanced
body, was thrust in between
them. It was Excalibur, taking sanctuary
with the Church from the
vengeance of the Law.</p>

<p>"We might tell Scally, I think,"
said Eileen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather!" assented the curate.
"He introduced us."</p>

<p>So Eileen communicated the great
news to Excalibur.</p>

<p>"You do approve, dear&mdash;don't
you?" she said.</p>

<p>Excalibur, instinctively realizing
that this was an occasion when liberties
might be taken, stood up on his
hind legs and placed his forepaws on
his mistress's shoulders. The curate
supported them both.</p>

<p>"And you will use your influence to
get us a living wage from somewhere&mdash;won't
you, old man?" added the
curate.</p>

<p>Excalibur tried to lick both their
faces at once&mdash;and succeeded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> the curate went away, but not
to London. He was sent instead to
a great manufacturing town in the
north, where the work was equally
hard, and where Anglican and Roman
and Salvationist fought grimly side
by side against the powers of drink
and disease and crime. During these
days, which ultimately rolled into
years, the curate lost his boyish
freshness and his unfortunate tendency
to put on flesh. He grew thin
and lathy; and, though his smile was
as ready and as magnetic as ever, he
seldom laughed.</p>

<p>He never failed, however, to write
a cheerful letter to Eileen every Monday
morning. He was getting a hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and twenty pounds a year now;
so his chances of becoming a millionaire
had increased by twenty per
cent.</p>

<p>Meantime his two confederates,
Excalibur and Eileen, continued to
reside at Much Moreham. Eileen
was still the recognized beauty of the
district, but she spread her net less
promiscuously than of yore. Girl
friends she always had in plenty, but
it was noticed that she avoided intimacy
with all eligible males of over
twenty and under forty-five years of
age. No one knew the reason for this
except Excalibur. Eileen used to read
Gerald's letters aloud to him every
Tuesday morning; sometimes the
letter contained a friendly message
to Excalibur himself.</p>

<p>In acknowledgment of this courtesy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Excalibur always sent his love
to the curate&mdash;Eileen wrote every
Friday&mdash;and he and Eileen walked
together, rain or shine, on Friday
afternoons to post the letter in the
next village. Much Moreham's post
office was too small to remain oblivious
to such a regular correspondence.</p>

<p>The curate was seen no more in his
old parish. Railroad journeys are
costly things and curates' holidays
rare. Besides, he had no overt excuse
for coming. And so life went on for
five years. The curate and Eileen
may have met during that period, for
Eileen sometimes went away visiting.
As Excalibur was not privileged to
accompany her on these occasions he
had no means of checking her movements;
but the chances are that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
never saw the curate, or I think she
would have told Excalibur about it.
We simply have to tell some one.</p>

<p>Then, quite suddenly, came a tremendous
change in Excalibur's life.
Eileen's brother-in-law&mdash;he was Excalibur's
master no longer, for Excalibur
had been transferred to Eileen
by deed of gift, at her own request, on
her first birthday after the curate's
departure&mdash;fell ill. There was an
operation and a crisis, and a deal
of unhappiness at Much Moreham;
then came convalescence, followed
by directions for a sea voyage of six
months. It was arranged that the
house should be shut up and the children
sent to their grandmother at
Bath.</p>

<p>"That settles everything and
everybody," said the gaunt man on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the sofa, "except you, Eileen? What
about you?"</p>

<p>"What about Scally?" inquired
Eileen.</p>

<p>Her brother-in-law apologetically
admitted that he had forgotten
Scally.</p>

<p>"Not quite myself at present," he
mentioned in extenuation.</p>

<p>"I am going to Aunt Ph&oelig;be," announced
Eileen.</p>

<p>"You are never going to introduce
Scally into Aunt Ph&oelig;be's establishment!"
cried Eileen's sister.</p>

<p>"No," said Eileen, "I am not."
She rubbed Excalibur's matted head
affectionately. "But I have arranged
for the dear man's future. He is
going to visit friends in the north.
Aren't you, darling?"</p>

<p>Excalibur, to whom this arrangement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
had been privately communicated
some days before, wagged his
tail and endeavored to look as intelligent
and knowing as possible. He
was not going to put his beloved mistress
to shame by admitting to her
relatives that he had not the faintest
idea what she was talking about.</p>

<p>However, he was soon to understand.
The next day Eileen took him
up to London by train. This in itself
was a tremendous adventure, though
alarming at first. He traveled in the
guard's van, it having been found
quite impossible to get him into an
ordinary compartment&mdash;or, rather,
to get any one else into the compartment
after he lay down on the
floor. So he traveled with the guard,
chained to the vacuum brake, and
shared that kindly official's dinner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>When they reached the terminus
there was much bustle and confusion.
The door of the van was thrown open
and porters dragged out the luggage
and submitted samples thereof to
overheated passengers, who invariably
failed to recognize their own
property and claimed someone else's.</p>

<p>Finally, when the luggage was all
cleared out, the guard took off Excalibur's
chain and facetiously invited
him to alight for London Town. Excalibur,
lumbering delicately across
the ribbed floor of the van, arrived
at the open doorway. Outside on the
platform he espied Eileen. Beside her
stood a tall figure in black.</p>

<p>With one tremendous roar of rapturous
recognition, Excalibur leaped
straight out of the van and launched
himself fairly and squarely at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
curate's chest. Luckily the curate
saw him coming.</p>

<p>"He knows you, all right," said
Eileen with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"He appears to," replied the curate.
"Afraid I don't dance the tango,
Scally, old man; but thanks for the
invitation, all the same!"</p>

<p>Excalibur spent the rest of the day
in London, where it must be admitted
he caused a genuine sensation&mdash;no
mean feat in such a blas&eacute; place.</p>

<p>In Bond Street the traffic had to
be held up both ways by benevolent
policemen, because Excalibur, feeling
pleasantly tired, lay down to rest.</p>

<p>When evening came they all dined
together in a cheap little restaurant
in Soho and were very gay, with the
gayety of people who are whistling to
keep their courage up. After dinner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Eileen said good-bye, first to Excalibur
and then to the curate. She was
much more demonstrative toward
the former than toward the latter,
which is the way of women.</p>

<p>Then the curate put Eileen into a
taxi and, having with the aid of the
commissionaire extracted Excalibur
from underneath&mdash;he had gone there
under some confused impression that
it was the guard's van again&mdash;said
good-bye for the last time; and Eileen,
smiling bravely, was whirled away
out of sight.</p>

<p>As the taxi turned a distant corner
and disappeared from view, it suddenly
occurred to Excalibur that he
had been left behind. Accordingly he
set off in pursuit.</p>

<p>The curate finally ran him to earth
in Buckingham Palace Road, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
is a long chase from Soho, where he
was sitting on the pavement, to the
grave inconvenience of the inhabitants
of Pimlico, and refusing to be
comforted. It took his new master
the best part of an hour to get him
to Euston Road, where it was discovered
they had missed the night
mail to the north. Accordingly they
walked to a rival station and took
another train.</p>

<p>In all this Excalibur was the instrument
of Destiny, as you shall hear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> coroner's jury was inclined at
the time to blame the signalman, but
the Board of Trade inquiry established
the fact that the accident was
due to the engine-driver's neglect to
keep a proper lookout. However, as
the driver was dead and his fireman
with him, the law very leniently took
no further action in the matter.</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the morning,
as the train was crossing a bleak
Yorkshire moor seven miles from Tetley
Junction, the curate suddenly left
the seat on which he lay stretched
dreaming of Eileen and flew across
the compartment on to the recumbent
form of a stout commercial traveler.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Then he rebounded to the floor
and woke up&mdash;unhurt.</p>

<p>"'Tis an accident, lad!" gasped
the commercial traveler as he got his
wind.</p>

<p>"So it seems," said the curate.
"Hold tight! She's rocking!"</p>

<p>The commercial traveler, who was
mechanically groping under the seat
for his boots,&mdash;commercial travelers
always remove their boots in third-class
railroad compartments when
on night journeys,&mdash;followed the curate's
advice and braced himself with
his feet against the opposite seat for
the coming <i>bouleversement</i>.</p>

<p>After the first shock the train had
gathered way again&mdash;the light engine
into which it had charged had
been thrown clear off the track&mdash;but
only for a moment. Suddenly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
reeling engine of the express left the
rails and staggered drunkenly along
the ballast. A moment later it turned
over, taking the guard's van and the
first four coaches with it, and the
whole train came to a standstill.</p>

<p>It was a corridor train, and unfortunately
for Gerald Gilmore and the
commercial traveler their coach fell
over corridor side downward. There
was no door on the other side of the
compartment&mdash;only three windows,
crossed by a stout brass bar. These
windows had suddenly become sky-lights.</p>

<p>They fought their way out at last.
Once he got the window open, the
curate experienced little difficulty in
getting through; but the commercial
traveler was corpulent and tenacious
of his boots, which he held persistently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in one hand while Gerald
tugged at the other. Still, he was
hauled up at last, and the two slid
down the perpendicular roof of the
coach to the permanent way.</p>

<p>"That's done, anyway!" panted
the drummer; and sitting down he
began to put on his boots.</p>

<p>"There's plenty more to do," said
the curate grimly, pulling off his coat.
"The front of the train is on fire.
Come!"</p>

<p>He turned and ran. Almost at his
first step he cannoned into a heavy
body in rapid motion. It was Excalibur.</p>

<p>"That you, old friend?" observed
the curate. "I was on my way to see
about you. Now that you are out,
you may as well come and bear a
hand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The pair sprinted along the line
toward the blazing coaches.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was dawn&mdash;gray, weeping, and
cheerless&mdash;on Tetley Moor. Another
engine had come up from behind
to take what was left of the train
back to the Junction. Seven coaches,
including the lordly sleeping saloon,
stood intact; four, with the engine
and tender, lay where they had fallen,
a mass of charred wood and twisted
metal.</p>

<p>A motor car belonging to a doctor
stood in the roadway a hundred yards
off, and its owner, with a brother of
the craft who had been a passenger
on the train, was attending to the
injured. There were fourteen of these
altogether, mostly suffering from
burns. These were made as comfortable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
as possible in sleeping berths
their owners had vacated.</p>

<p>"Take your seats, please!" said
the surviving guard in a subdued
voice. He spoke at the direction of a
big man in a heavy overcoat, who
appeared to have taken charge of the
salvage operations. The passengers
clambered up into the train.</p>

<p>Only one hesitated. He was a long,
lean young man, black from head to
foot with soot and oil. His left arm
was badly burned; and seeing a doctor
disengaged at last, he came forward
to have it dressed.</p>

<p>The big man in the heavy overcoat
approached him.</p>

<p>"My name is Caversham," he said.
"I happen to be a director of the
company. If you will give me your
name and address I will see to it that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
your services to-night are suitably
recognized. The way you got those
two children out of the first coach
was splendid, if I may be allowed to
say so. We did not even know they
were there."</p>

<p>The young man's teeth suddenly
flashed out into a white smile against
the blackness of his face.</p>

<p>"Neither did I, sir," he said. "Let
me introduce you to the responsible
party."</p>

<p>He whistled. Out of the gray dawn
loomed an eerie monster, badly
singed, wagging its tail.</p>

<p>"Scally, old man," said the curate,
"this gentleman wants to present you
with an illuminated address. Thank
him prettily!" Then, to the doctor:
"I'm ever so much obliged to you;
it's quite comfortable now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>He began stiffly to pull on his coat
and waistcoat. Lord Caversham,
lending a hand, noted the waistcoat
and said quickly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you travel in my compartment?
I should like to have a word
with you if I may."</p>

<p>"I think I had better go and have
a look at those poor folks in the
sleeper first," replied the curate.
"They may require my services professionally."</p>

<p>"At the Junction, then, perhaps?"
suggested Lord Caversham.</p>

<p>At the Junction, however, the curate
found a special waiting to proceed
north by a loop line; and, being
in no mind to receive compliments or
waste his substance on a hotel, he departed
forthwith, taking his charred
confederate, Excalibur, with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Fortune</span>, once she takes a fancy
to you, is not readily shaken off, however,
as most successful men are always
trying to forget. A fortnight
later Lord Caversham, leaving his
hotel in a great northern town, encountered
an acquaintance he had no
difficulty whatever in recognizing.</p>

<p>It was Excalibur, jammed fast between
two stationary tramcars&mdash;he
had not yet shaken down to town life&mdash;submitting
to a painful but effective
process of extraction at the hands
of a posse of policemen and tram conductors,
shrilly directed by a small
but commanding girl of the lodging-house-drudge
variety.</p>

<p>When this enterprise had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
brought to a successful conclusion
and the congested traffic moved on
by the overheated policemen, Lord
Caversham crossed the street and
tapped the damsel on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Can you kindly inform me where
the owner of that dog may be found?"
he inquired politely.</p>

<p>"Yas. Se'nty-one Pilgrim Street.
But 'e won't sell him."</p>

<p>"Should I be likely to find him at
home if I called now?"</p>

<p>"Yas. Bin in bed since the accident.
Got a nasty arm."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would not mind accompanying
me back to Pilgrim
Street in my car?"</p>

<p>After that Mary Ellen's mind became
an incoherent blur. A stately
limousine glided up; Mary Ellen was
handed in by a footman and Excalibur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was stuffed in after her in installments.
The grand gentleman entered
by the opposite door and sat down
beside her; but Mary Ellen was much
too dazed to converse with him.</p>

<p>The arrival of the equipage in Pilgrim
Street was the greatest moment
of Mary Ellen's life.</p>

<p>Meantime upstairs in the first-floor
front the curate, lying in his uncomfortable
flock bed, was saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you really mean it, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do mean it. If those two children
had been burned to death unnoticed
I should never have forgiven
myself, and the public would never
have forgiven the company."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, since you say that, you&mdash;well,
you could do me a service.
Could you possibly use your influence
to get me a billet&mdash;I'm not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
asking for an incumbency; any old
curacy would do&mdash;a billet I could
marry on?" He flushed scarlet. "I&mdash;we
have been waiting a long time
now."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, and the
curate wondered whether he had
been too mercenary in his request.
Then Lord Caversham asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you getting at present?"</p>

<p>"A hundred and twenty a year."</p>

<p>This was about two thirds of the
salary Lord Caversham paid his
chauffeur. He asked another question
in his curious, abrupt staccato
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How much do you want?"</p>

<p>"We could make both ends meet on
two hundred; but another fifty would
enable me to make her a lot more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
comfortable," said the curate wistfully.</p>

<p>The great man surveyed him silently&mdash;wonderingly,
too, if the curate
had known. Presently he asked:</p>

<p>"Afraid of hard work?"</p>

<p>"No work is hard to a man with a
wife and a home of his own," replied
the curate with simple fervor.</p>

<p>Lord Caversham smiled grimly.
He had more homes of his own than
he could conveniently live in, and he
had been married three times; but
even he found work hard now and
then.</p>

<p>"I wonder!" he said. "Well, good-afternoon.
I should like to be introduced
to your fianc&eacute;e some day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A tramp</span> opened the rectory gate
and shambled up the neat gravel
walk toward the house. Taking a
short cut through the shrubbery he
emerged suddenly on a little lawn.</p>

<p>On the lawn a lady was sitting in a
basket chair beside a perambulator,
the occupant of which was slumbering
peacefully. A small but intensely
capable nursemaid, prone on the
grass in a curvilinear attitude, was
acting as tunnel to a young gentleman
of three who was impersonating
a locomotive.</p>

<p>The tramp approached the group
and asked huskily for alms. He was
a burly and unpleasant specimen of
his class&mdash;a class all too numerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
on the outskirts of the great industrial
parish of Smeltingborough. The
lady in the basket chair looked up.</p>

<p>"The rector is out," she said. "If
you go into the town you will find him
at the Church Hall and he will investigate
your case."</p>

<p>"Oh, the rector is out, is he?" repeated
the tramp in tones of distinct
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eileen.</p>

<p>The tramp advanced another pace.</p>

<p>"Give us half a crown!" he said.
"I haven't had a bite of food since
yesterday, lady&mdash;nor a drink neither,"
he added humorously.</p>

<p>"Please go away!" said the lady.
"You know where to find the rector."</p>

<p>The tramp smiled unpleasantly,
but made no attempt to move.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"You refuse to go away?" the
lady said.</p>

<p>"I'll go for half a crown," replied
the tramp with the gracious air of
one anxious to oblige a lady.</p>

<p>"Watch baby for a moment, Mary
Ellen," said Eileen.</p>

<p>She rose and disappeared into the
house, followed by the gratified smile
of the tramp. He was a reasonable
man and knew that ladies did not
wear pockets.</p>

<p>"Thirsty weather," he remarked
affably.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen, keeping one hand on
the shoulder of Master Gerald Caversham
Gilmore and the other on the
edge of the baby's perambulator,
merely chuckled sardonically.</p>

<p>The next moment there were footsteps
round the corner of the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and Eileen reappeared. She was
clinging with both hands to the collar
of an enormous dog. Its tongue lolled
from its great jaws; its tail waved
menacingly from side to side; its
great limbs were bent as though for a
spring. Its eyes were half closed as
though to focus the exact distance.</p>

<p>"Run!" cried Eileen to the tramp.
"I can't hold him in much longer!"</p>

<p>This was true enough, except that
when Eileen said "in" she meant
"up." But the tramp did not linger
to discuss grammar. There was a
scurry of feet, the gate banged and
he was gone.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief Eileen let go of
Excalibur's collar. Excalibur promptly
collapsed on the grass and went to
sleep again.</p>
